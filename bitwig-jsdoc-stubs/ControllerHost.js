/* API Version - 3.1.2 */

/**
 * An interface representing the host application to the script. A singleton instance of this interface is
 * available in the global scope of each script. The methods provided by this interface can be divided in
 * different categories:
 * 
 * 1. functions for registering the script in Bitwig Studio, so that it can be listed, detected and configured
 * in the controller preferences. The methods that belong to this group are {@link #defineController},
 * {@link #defineMidiPorts}, {@link #defineSysexIdentityReply} and {@link #addDeviceNameBasedDiscoveryPair}.
 * 2. functions for creating objects that provide access to the various areas of Bitwig Studio to the script.
 * The name of those methods typically start with `create...` 3. functions for printing to the Control Surface
 * Console, which can be opened from the `View` menu of Bitwig Studio. 4. functions for determining the name
 * of the host application, API version, the host operating system and such.
 * 
 * The first group of methods should be called on the global scope of the script. The function in the second
 * and third group are typically called from the init method of the script or other handler functions. The
 * last group is probably only required in rare cases and can be called any time.
 *
 * @mainpage Introduction

Welcome to the Bitwig Control Surface API.<br/>

The pages shown here include the reference documentation for the various interfaces and functions provided
by the API.<br/>

The best starting point for becoming familiar with the API within these pages is the documentation of the
{@link Host} interface. A singleton instance of that interface is available in the scope of each script.
In addition it is highly recommended to also walk through the <b>Control Surface Scripting Guide</b> that is
available from the @em Help menu in Bitwig Studio.
