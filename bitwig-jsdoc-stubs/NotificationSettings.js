/* API Version - 3.1.2 */

/**
 * Bitwig Studio supports automatic visual feedback from controllers that shows up as popup notifications. For
 * example when the selected track or the current device preset was changed on the controller, these
 * notifications are shown, depending on the configuration.
 * 
 * It depends both on the users preference and the capabilities of the controller hardware if a certain
 * notification should be shown. This interface provides functions for enabling/disabling the various kinds of
 * automatic notifications from the hardware point of view. Typically, controllers that include an advanced
 * display don't need to show many notifications additionally on screen. For other controllers that do not
 * include a display it might be useful to show all notifications. By default all notifications are disabled.
 * 
 * In addition, the user can enable or disable all notifications the have been enabled using this interface in
 * the preferences dialog of Bitwig Studio.
