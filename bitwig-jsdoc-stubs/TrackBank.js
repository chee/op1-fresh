/* API Version - 3.1.2 */

/**
 * A track bank provides access to a range of tracks and their scenes (clip launcher slots) in Bitwig Studio.
 * Instances of track bank are configured with a fixed number of tracks and scenes and represent an excerpt of
 * a larger list of tracks and scenes. Various methods are provided for scrolling to different sections of the
 * track/scene list. It basically acts like a 2-dimensional window moving over the grid of tracks and scenes.
 * 
 * To receive an instance of track bank that supports all kinds of tracks call {@link ControllerHost#createTrackBank}.
 * Additional methods are provided in the {@link ControllerHost} interface to create track banks that include only main
 * tracks ({@link ControllerHost#createMainTrackBank}) or only effect tracks ({@link ControllerHost#createEffectTrackBank}).
 *
 * @see {@link ControllerHost#createTrackBank}
 * @see {@link ControllerHost#createMainTrackBank}
 * @see {@link ControllerHost#createEffectTrackBank}
